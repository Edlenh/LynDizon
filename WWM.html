     <p>"My goal was to be more productive and manage my time more effectively, 
      Lyn helped me realise patterns that were disturbing or distracting my productivity.
       It was a wholesome experience to understand and rewire my routine making it more purposeful. 
       I am grateful for the opportunity given by Lyn, as my coaching was handled with care, honesty,  and understanding"

      <p> "You made me a better person overall, 
        I had a hard time asking myself some seriously difficult questions and then doing something about it, 
        she helped me open up to myself about the possibilities of what could happen if I actually faced them. 
        And she is such a lovely person, I loved talking to her, and listening to what she had to share. 
        I think everyone is looking for that motivation in life that can help them test their limits and be better, for me it was her"

    <div class="testimonial">
     
    "I had some sessions with Lyn where we spoke about my goals. 
    Lyn helped me map out my goals in an achievable way. During the sessions, Lyn was extremely easy to talk to. 
    She made sure that the conversation flowed and was an amazing listener. 
The most impactful part of our session was when she pointed out the way I was talking about my future goals. I was talking about them in maybes, 
'probably', and I'll try to as opposed to clearly saying what I'll do to achieve them. 
She made me realize that I was already planning not to achieve my goal through my speech. 
I realized that if I change the way I affirm my process through speaking it can reconfirm the achieve-ability of my goal for myself.
 I've tried to keep this technique in mind as I set new daily goals. Saying I will …. 
 As opposed to I will try to…..I really appreciated how comfortable the sessions were. 
 I felt able to open up about some insecurities with Lyn and I was grateful for the guidance she gave"
